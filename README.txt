The dataset used by us is Flickr8K Dataset.

The programs for the project is dependent on multiple pickled files that will be created as you keep on following the instructions below.

1. run the Inception_2048vector_generation.ipynb to generate 2048 vectors for further tasks.

2. run the read_for_data.py while placing it within the Flickr8k_text folder. (this file is used to load all the captions along with image names)

3. run the test_images_pickle file while placing it within the Flickr8k_text folder. 

4. Now, run the preprocessing_ordering_data_for_model.ipynb file to order the data accordingly for the training phase.

5. Now run the Image_Caption_Generation_Training.ipynb file which will provide predicted captions for the image and train the model.

6. Make sure you save your model using checkpoints accordingly. As you will require a saved model for the other tasks in the project.

7. Now run the Tasks_using_built_network.ipynb file for results for similar image finding task, similar words finding task and
   inferring images from sentence of words task.   

8. t_SNE_viz .ipynb file was used for creating tsne plots for image and word embeddings.


Dataset has been provided in this zipped folder.

This folder also includes the Project Report and the Project Poster.
